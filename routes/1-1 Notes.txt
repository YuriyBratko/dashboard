1-1 important notes
- Alex behavior

To Nikita:
- How we manage allocation between projects? Yoram is pushing for allocating ALL resources in peak periods to Websites.
We need ground rules to protect CRM teams
- Concentrating on improvements in BI (and Analyst) teams
- Want to push the new prod move

To me:
- 1-1 with Chen
- Discuss Ela's involvement and position in BI communication with Yaniv and Yoram
- Issue with testing BI reports in prod - how can be done alternatively?
- Access to Panda CRM, MT4 and prod DB 
- Get team uildings for teams (separately) with $25-30 budget per team


My plan concentrate:
- BI project






1) All Brand PnL reports
Need ETA estimates to UAT
pick one exchange rate to start with
same KPI's
2) Hourly measurment
Sequence: Itrader FTO Global (after review) GMO (duplicating)
Brand by Brand
3) Hourly measurements all brands together
